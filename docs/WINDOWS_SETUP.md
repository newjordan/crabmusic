# Windows Audio Setup Guide

This guide shows you how to capture system audio (music, games, etc.) on Windows **without installing any additional software**.

## Option 1: Enable Stereo Mix (Built-in, No Extra Software)

Windows has a built-in feature called **Stereo Mix** that captures system audio. It's free and already on your computer.

### Step 1: Enable Stereo Mix

1. **Right-click the speaker icon** in your system tray (bottom-right corner)
2. Click **"Sounds"** or **"Sound settings"**
3. Click **"Recording"** tab (or "More sound settings" ‚Üí "Recording")
4. **Right-click in the empty space** and check:
   - ‚òë **Show Disabled Devices**
   - ‚òë **Show Disconnected Devices**
5. You should now see **"Stereo Mix"** in the list
6. **Right-click "Stereo Mix"** ‚Üí **"Enable"**
7. **Right-click "Stereo Mix"** ‚Üí **"Set as Default Device"** (optional)
8. Click **"OK"**

### Step 2: Run CrabMusic

```bash
# List devices to confirm Stereo Mix is available
cargo run --release -- --list-devices

# Run with Stereo Mix
cargo run --release -- --device "Stereo Mix"
```

### Step 3: Play Music and Visualize!

- Open Spotify, YouTube, or any music player
- Play some music
- Watch CrabMusic visualize it in real-time! üéµ

### Troubleshooting Stereo Mix

**"I don't see Stereo Mix"**
- Some audio drivers don't include Stereo Mix (especially Realtek HD Audio on newer systems)
- Try updating your audio drivers from your motherboard/laptop manufacturer
- If still not available, see Option 2 below

**"Stereo Mix is there but not working"**
- Make sure it's **enabled** (not grayed out)
- Make sure it's **not muted**
- Try setting it as the **default recording device**
- Restart your computer after enabling it

**"Audio quality is poor"**
- Right-click Stereo Mix ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Advanced
- Set format to **"2 channel, 16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)"** or higher
- Click Apply

## Option 2: Use VoiceMeeter (Free, More Features)

If Stereo Mix isn't available or doesn't work well, **VoiceMeeter** is a free virtual audio mixer that's more reliable.

### Why VoiceMeeter?

- ‚úÖ Free and lightweight
- ‚úÖ Works on all Windows systems
- ‚úÖ Better audio quality than Stereo Mix
- ‚úÖ More control over audio routing
- ‚úÖ Can mix multiple sources

### Setup VoiceMeeter

1. **Download VoiceMeeter** (free): https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/
2. **Install and restart** your computer
3. **Open VoiceMeeter**
4. **Configure audio routing:**
   - Set your speakers as **Hardware Out A1**
   - In Windows Sound Settings, set **VoiceMeeter Input** as default playback device
   - In VoiceMeeter, enable **A1** button for Hardware Input 1

5. **Run CrabMusic:**
```bash
cargo run --release -- --device "VoiceMeeter Output"
```

## Option 3: VB-Audio Virtual Cable (What You Tried)

This is what you tried before. It works but requires more setup:

1. Download VB-Audio Virtual Cable: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
2. Install and restart
3. Set CABLE Input as default playback device in Windows
4. Run: `cargo run --release -- --device "CABLE Output"`

**Downside:** You won't hear audio unless you also set up playback routing.

## Comparison

| Method | Pros | Cons | Recommended? |
|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **Stereo Mix** | Built-in, no install, simple | Not available on all systems, lower quality | ‚úÖ **Try this first** |
| **VoiceMeeter** | Free, reliable, good quality | Requires install, more complex | ‚úÖ **Best if Stereo Mix unavailable** |
| **VB-Audio Cable** | Works everywhere | Requires install, complex routing, no audio playback | ‚ùå Not recommended |
