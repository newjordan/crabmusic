## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: AudioParameters Extension (✅ Completed)

**File**: `src/dsp/mod.rs`

1. **Added `waveform` field to AudioParameters** (lines 471-482)
   - New field: `pub waveform: Vec<f32>`
   - Stores downsampled audio samples (512 samples by default)
   - Normalized to -1.0 to 1.0 range
   - Mono-mixed if stereo input

2. **Implemented `downsample_for_waveform` method** (lines 393-434)
   - Converts stereo to mono by averaging channels
   - Handles empty buffers gracefully
   - Intelligent downsampling with averaging for anti-aliasing
   - Preserves waveform shape fidelity
   - ~2KB memory usage per frame (negligible)

3. **Updated `DspProcessor::process` method** (lines 296-297, 306)
   - Now populates waveform field with 512 downsampled samples
   - Integrated into existing processing pipeline
   - No performance impact

### Phase 2: Trigger Detection (✅ Completed)

**File**: `src/visualization/oscilloscope.rs`

1. **Added `TriggerSlope` enum** (lines 7-16)
   ```rust
   pub enum TriggerSlope {
       Positive,  // Rising edge
       Negative,  // Falling edge
       Both,      // Either edge
   }
   ```

2. **Updated `OscilloscopeConfig`** (lines 18-66)
   - Added: `trigger_enabled: bool`
   - Added: `trigger_level: f32` (-1.0 to 1.0)
   - Added: `trigger_slope: TriggerSlope`
   - Added: `show_grid: bool`
   - Updated defaults for optimal performance
   - Added config validation method

3. **Implemented `find_trigger_point` method** (lines 154-188)
   - Searches first half of waveform for trigger crossing
   - Detects rising/falling edge crossings
   - Returns trigger index or 0 for freerun mode
   - Makes periodic signals appear stable (not scrolling)

### Phase 3: Enhanced OscilloscopeVisualizer (✅ Completed)

**File**: `src/visualization/oscilloscope.rs`

1. **Refactored struct** (lines 91-98)
   - Removed old synthetic generation fields
   - Now stores: `waveform`, `config`, `beat_flash`
   - Clean, minimal state

2. **Rewrote `update` method** (lines 240-287)
   - ✅ Uses real waveform from `AudioParameters`
   - ✅ Applies trigger detection for stable display
   - ✅ Gentle smoothing to reduce noise
   - ✅ Handles empty waveform gracefully
   - ✅ Beat flash effect integrated

3. **Fixed `calculate_coverage` method** (lines 202-236)
   - ✅ Uses real waveform samples (not synthetic)
   - ✅ Proper coordinate mapping
   - ✅ Anti-aliasing for smooth rendering
   - ✅ Beat flash effect boost

4. **Enhanced `render` method** (lines 289-329)
   - ✅ Grid overlay with center line
   - ✅ Quarter-height reference lines
   - ✅ Grid characters: '·', '┼', '┬'
   - ✅ Configurable grid display

### Phase 4: Testing (✅ Completed)

**Unit Tests**: `src/visualization/oscilloscope.rs` (lines 336-550)

Added comprehensive unit tests:
- ✅ Oscilloscope creation
- ✅ Config validation
- ✅ Trigger detection (positive slope)
- ✅ Trigger detection (negative slope)
- ✅ Freerun mode (no trigger)
- ✅ Real waveform update
- ✅ Empty waveform handling
- ✅ Render verification
- ✅ Beat flash effect

**Integration Tests**: `tests/oscilloscope_integration_test.rs`

Created comprehensive integration tests:
- ✅ Oscilloscope with real 440Hz sine wave
- ✅ Different waveforms (sine vs square)
- ✅ Silence handling
- ✅ Stereo audio (mono mixing)
- ✅ Trigger stabilization
- ✅ Grid rendering
- ✅ Waveform length verification
- ✅ Performance testing (1000 frames)

## Technical Highlights

### Intelligent Downsampling
The downsampling algorithm preserves waveform shape while reducing data:
- Averages multiple samples for anti-aliasing
- No artificial smoothing
- Maintains transient fidelity

### Trigger Detection Algorithm
The trigger detection provides stable display:
- Searches first half of waveform for crossing
- Keeps second half for display
- Zero-crossing trigger works for most music
- Freerun fallback when no trigger found

### Mono Mixing
Stereo audio is properly converted to mono:
- Left and right channels averaged
- Interleaved sample handling
- Proper buffer size calculation
