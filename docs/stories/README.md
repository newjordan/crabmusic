# CrabMusic Implementation Stories

This directory contains individual story files that break down the implementation of crabmusic into manageable, well-defined tasks.

## Directory Purpose

Each story represents a **discrete unit of work** that can be assigned to a developer (human or AI agent) with clear:
- Description of what to build
- Acceptance criteria for completion
- Technical approach and architecture references
- Dependencies on other stories
- Testing requirements

## Story Naming Convention

Stories follow the pattern: `[EPIC-###]-story-name.md`

**Epic Prefixes**:
- `FOUND-` - Project Foundation
- `AUDIO-` - Audio Capture System
- `DSP-` - DSP Processing
- `VIZ-` - Visualization Engine
- `RENDER-` - Terminal Rendering
- `CONFIG-` - Configuration System
- `PIPELINE-` - Pipeline Integration
- `TEST-` - Testing & Validation
- `DOCS-` - Documentation & Release
- `RELEASE-` - Release processes

## Story File Structure

Each story file contains:

```markdown
# [STORY-ID] Story Title

**Epic**: [Epic Name]
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking) | P1 (Required) | P2 (Nice-to-have)
**Estimated Effort**: [X days]
**Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Complete

## Description
[What needs to be built and why]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Checkable criteria for completion

## Technical Approach
[Implementation guidance and architecture references]

## Dependencies
- Depends on: [Other stories]
- Blocks: [Stories waiting on this]

## Architecture References
[Links to relevant architecture sections]

## Testing Requirements
[What tests are needed]

## Notes for AI Agent
[Specific implementation guidance]
```

## Current Story Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Stories
*(None yet - ready to start implementation)*

### üèóÔ∏è Ready to Implement (Critical Path)
These stories form the **minimum viable product** (MVP) path:

1. **FOUND-001** - Project Setup and Scaffolding
2. **AUDIO-001** - Define Audio Capture Interface *(needs creation)*
3. **AUDIO-002** - Implement CPAL Audio Capture
4. **AUDIO-003** - Ring Buffer for Audio Pipeline *(needs creation)*
5. **DSP-001** - FFT Processor Implementation
6. **DSP-002** - Frequency Band Extraction *(needs creation)*
7. **VIZ-001** - Grid Buffer Data Structure *(needs creation)*
8. **VIZ-003** - Character Coverage Algorithm *(needs creation)*
9. **VIZ-004** - Visualizer Trait Design *(needs creation)*
10. **VIZ-005** - Sine Wave Visualizer (MVP)
11. **RENDER-001** - Terminal Initialization *(needs creation)*
12. **RENDER-002** - Ratatui Integration *(needs creation)*
13. **PIPELINE-001** - Main Application Loop

### üìã Sample Stories Created
The following stories have been created as **scaffolded templates** ready for agent completion:
- ‚úÖ `FOUND-001-project-setup.md`
- ‚úÖ `AUDIO-002-cpal-implementation.md`
- ‚úÖ `DSP-001-fft-processor.md`
- ‚úÖ `VIZ-005-sine-wave-visualizer.md`
- ‚úÖ `PIPELINE-001-main-loop.md`

### üìù Stories Needed
Additional stories need to be created following the template. See `docs/implementation-plan.md` for the complete list of stories across all epics.

## How to Use These Stories

### For Human Developers
1. Pick a story that has no unmet dependencies
2. Read the full story file
3. Implement according to acceptance criteria
4. Run tests specified in "Testing Requirements"
5. Update story status to "Complete"
6. Move to next story

### For AI Agents (Dev Mode)
1. Load story file: `Read docs/stories/[STORY-ID]-*.md`
2. Load architecture references specified in story
3. Implement according to "Technical Approach" section
4. Follow "Notes for AI Agent" guidance
5. Generate tests per "Testing Requirements"
6. Validate against "Acceptance Criteria"

### Development Workflow
```
1. Select story from critical path or epic
2. Check dependencies are complete
3. Load relevant architecture docs (see story's "Architecture References")
4. Implement with tests
5. Validate acceptance criteria
6. Update story status
7. Commit changes
8. Move to next story
```

## Story Priority Guide

**P0 (Blocking)**: Required for MVP, blocks other critical work
- Must be completed in order for MVP to function
- Should be implemented first

**P1 (Required)**: Required for MVP release, but not blocking
- Needed for a complete MVP
- Can be implemented in parallel with P0 stories where dependencies allow

**P2 (Nice-to-have)**: Post-MVP enhancements
- Improves user experience but not required for initial release
- Implement after MVP is validated

## Development Milestones

See `docs/implementation-plan.md` for detailed milestone breakdown, but quick reference:

- **Milestone 1**: Foundation (Week 1)
- **Milestone 2**: Audio & DSP (Week 2-3)
- **Milestone 3**: Static Visualization (Week 3-4)
- **Milestone 4**: üéâ MVP Integration (Week 4-5)
- **Milestone 5**: Polish & Release (Week 6)

## Creating New Stories

When creating additional story files:

1. Copy structure from existing stories
2. Use epic prefix and sequential numbering
3. Fill in all sections with specific details
4. Link to relevant architecture documentation
5. Define clear, testable acceptance criteria
6. Include "Notes for AI Agent" with implementation hints
7. Update `implementation-plan.md` with the new story
8. Update this README with story status
